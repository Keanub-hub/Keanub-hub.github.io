     <p> My name is Keanu Boulany. I was born on August 13, 2001 and am from Maiden, North Carolina. I am currently studying at Milligan College which is located in Tennesse.
       I am on the Men's soccer team at Milligan and I am a rising sophomore, graduating in 2023. I am majoring in Information systems and plan to pursue a career as an IT.
       My passion is playing soccer as I decided to continue my career at Milligan. I enjoy editing videos and messing with computers, probably downloading too much, causing my laptop to slow down.
       I also enjoy playing guitar, playing golf, and being with family and friends! </p>

     <p> Maiden is a small town located in North Carolina. I went to High school in Maiden and it was known for its football team. Maiden is known as "The Biggest little football town".
     I played soccer, football, and golf at Maiden high school. Maiden's main sport was football and the soccer team was never recognized, due to the team's poor performance over the years. 
       I love this small town with all my heart and it will always be home!
